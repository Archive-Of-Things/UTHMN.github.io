                            I have been looking into getting a proper domain and
                            <br> I figured out Uthmn.com makes the most sense. But I was
                            <br>
                            looking for something cheap when I found
                            <a href="https://www.ionos.co.uk/?__lf=Checkout" class="BlogLink">Ionos!</a>
                            <br>
                            I swear this is not an ad but like ionos looked cheap,
                            <br> their starter plan was £1 a year for the first year
                            <br>
                            then it goes to £15 - £17 a year which is still good,
                            <br> and they supply a free email with 200gb and 10k subdomains.

                        <p class="Bpt">
                        Short answer yes.
                        <br>
                        Long answer:
                        <br>
                        Every two seconds I need to figure out something just
                        <br> for the sites aesthetic like why does a br tag called br?
                        <br>
                        why not bl which could stand for break line. What does
                        <br> br stand for?!??!? Ontop of this, not all browsers render html
                        <br>
                        the same and those tutorials on youtube make no sense
                        <br> and sometimes they even copy paste. So to end this post,
                        <br>
                        yes it does slowly kill my braincells.
